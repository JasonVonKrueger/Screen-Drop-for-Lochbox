This is version 2 of Screen Drop. This version allows users to snip the screen rather than only take full screen shots.

### Features

* Innovative orange lines
* Kick-ass sound effects
* Detailed GUI labels

### Features desired

## Usage

The .exe should be copied to %LOCALAPPDATA%\ClaytonStateUniversity\Applets\.  For now, I just created a desktop shortcut with the hot-key
combination of SHIFT+ALT+P.
